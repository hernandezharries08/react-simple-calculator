# react-simple-calculator

Very basic calculator project using react.

To start the project, use the commands:

`npm install`
`npm start`

This was a project to complete the React Basics course by Meta which features the knowledge learned during the course.

For anyone taking the course in Coursera, feel free to check this repository for reference.

Note: I did add the history variable and some styling in App.css to the project which is just some additional features and are not included in the requirements of the project.

See the project requirements in the INSTRUCTIONS.md file
